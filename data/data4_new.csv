I spent so long trying to think out that last questions that I lost track of what we were actually focusing on in this survey! Clearly I have a problem moving on when I do not have a reasonable answer for a question. Maybe that will provide you some more insight into who I am. 

Also just a heads up, when asking our opinions about political figures, you spelled the name ""Macro Rubio"". I assume you meant Marco Rubio, but I selected ""not applicable"" because I never know what these things are actually testing us on, and didn't want to give an opinion on someone who doesn't exist.

I would be very curious to know if there was some kind of pattern for the game. Anything other than total randomness. Or was it staged to purposely give wrong answers at certain intervals? Was there ever a chance at doing well at this game? I'd love to know the answers to these questions and find out more about the work that you are doing. How exactly that relates to my psychological well-being, and why you asked to know the medications I am on.

I suppose I will clarify on that, all of those have been prescribed to me after an acute aortic dissection. So, the frequent thoughts of death is not something that is really out of line for me. I'm on borrowed time as it is, as I would have been dead 3 years ago without modern medicine.

So, please keep that in mind when looking over my medical history and the questions related to that. The severe fatigue and anxiety is likely all wrapped up within my physical ailments, as well as the byproduct of the human brain knowing it's dodged death but could be hanging around any corner up ahead.
